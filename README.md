# MISP

## Introduction

**MI**cro li**SP** (or **M**osty **I**mpractical li**SP** or bare **MI**nimum li**SP**)
is an exercise in LISP implementation aimed at obtainig minimal feature set that will 
allow to boostrap more complex features.

Highly influenced by [Lisp in Less Than 200 Lines in C](https://carld.github.io/2017/06/20/lisp-in-less-than-200-lines-of-c.html)
and [Make a Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) and [Lispy](https://norvig.com/lispy.html).

It's third (or fourth, or who would count) versions being developed currently. With goal
of initial implementation in Python, followed by C. Then refactored as library, so it can possibly
serve as a scripting engine in other projects.

Older version is available online on [Misp on Repl.it](https://repl.it/@karolciba/MostlyImpracticalLisp).
